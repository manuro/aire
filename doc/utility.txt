Module: utility

1. Abstract
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The utility package implements some basic utility functionality for threads, 
time measurement, streams and I/O.

2. Example
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Using the time measurment

#include "Watch.h"
// Start the timer
aire::StopWatch::GetInstance()->getTimer("One timer")->start();
... // Do something
// Stop the timer
aire::StopWatch::GetInstance()->getTimer("One timer")->stop();
// Print the timers
aire::StopWatch::GetInstance()->printTime(std::cout, false);

3. Design
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The module consits of the following classes:
* Event - Signal and event 
* Guard - Automated lock and unlock
* Mutex - Simple mutex 
* Singelton - Singleton template with lock and unlock
* Stream - Synchronized stream for thread output
* Thread - Basic threads
* Timer - Basic timer
* Watch - Collection of timers
* Test - Test case execution wrapper
* Tools - Some very tricky helper functions
* System - Basic system class

4. Test
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All test cases are included in the test harness. They can be build and 
executed using the makefile by "make arch=<yourarch> test".

The following test cases are implemented to test the utility module:
* CheckTimer - Creates a timer and checks if the overhead is not huge.
* CreateThread - Creates and join a single thread.
* LockWithMutex - Lock and unlock using 2 threads and the Mutex class.
* SignalAndWait - Signal and wait using 2 threads and the Event class.
* SimpleWatch - Time multiple code parts and print the results.
* ThreadOutput - Print out synchronized thread id.

5. Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Singleton template is thread-safe by lock and unlock in the GetInstance() 
using the Guard class. Please cache the usage of the Singleton by assigning 
it to a global scoped variable to avoid lock and unlock everytime you access 
the singleton.
